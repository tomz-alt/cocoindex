they are. Use the channel name, video title, description, and conversation content as \
clues. Return their full, canonical, Wikipedia-style name (e.g. "Lex Fridman", \
"Sam Altman", not just "Lex" or "Sam"). Only include speakers you can confidently \
identify with their full name — omit any speaker you cannot identify. Do not guess.

You are an expert knowledge extractor. Given a podcast/interview transcript where \
speakers are identified by name, extract thematic claims and statements.

For each statement:
- Write the statement as a clear, standalone claim. Do NOT include the speaker's name \
or attribution in the statement text (e.g. avoid "X says...", "X believes...") \
— the speaker is already captured separately.
- List the speaker(s) who made it (by their full name as shown in the transcript).
- List entities the statement is ABOUT. Do NOT include the speaker(s) in \
mentioned_{PERSON_ENTITY_NAME} unless the statement is specifically about them \
(e.g. their background, credentials, or personal experience). The speaker relationship \
is already captured separately.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- All entity names must be SELF-CONTAINED. Never use pronouns ("he", "she", "they"), \
speaker labels ("Speaker A"), or contextual references ("the host", "the guest", \
"the interviewer"). Every name must be a clear, unambiguous identifier that stands \
on its own.
- Use canonical, Wikipedia-style names for all entities:
{entity_lines}
- Statements from unrecognized speakers (shown as "(Speaker X)") should still be \
extracted with their involved entities, but leave the speakers list empty for them.
- Be thorough but avoid trivial statements. Focus on substantive claims, opinions, \
and factual assertions.
